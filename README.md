Networked Physics Test Project in Unreal Engine 4

This is an attempt to create a stable, networked-physics solution in Unreal Engine and is considered a 'Live' project. It's currently a bit of a mess and needs clean up, and by no means finalized.

Feel free to contribute to, or study the source code.
