Networked Physics Test Project in Unreal Engine 4

This is an attempt to create a stable, simplified networked-physics solution in Unreal Engine 4 with client-side prediction and reconciliation.

This is based heavily on the work done by Glenn Fielder, here : http://gafferongames.com/

It doesn't work properly yet, which is why I'm inviting people to both contribute to and learn from the source code. This is by no means set-up in the best way possible (Movement should be done in a UMovementComponent for example) - but it's set up for simplicity until the code works properly.

Feel free to contribute to, or study the source code. If you use it in a game, crediting the author(s) of the code wouldn't go amiss :)
